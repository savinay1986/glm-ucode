# Description
Five [Intel Microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Microcode) (uCode) Sequencer's arrays for Atom Goldmont core named according to our guesses:

**ms_rom.txt** - the first array of Microcode Sequencer, with triads of 48 bits micro-operations of the Intel Small Core

**ms_irom.txt** - the second read-only array which we think contains immediate used in mushroom

**ms_patch_imm.txt** - immediates for ucode patch from patch RAM

**ms_match_patch.txt** - dump of 31 bits match/patch registers pairs. They refer directly to msrom with 0-15 bits of match register and 16-30 bits of patch register shifted right by one bit

**ms_patch_ram.txt** - extracted content of MS Patch RAM. It contains uops divided into four groups (1st is all first uops from each triad, 2nd - all second uops and so on). This data combined into triads can be found in msrom at 0x7c00 UIP
